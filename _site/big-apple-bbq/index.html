<title>Big Apple BBQ &#8211; Stu MacDonald</title>
<meta name="description" content="Whilst in the US for a holiday we encountered the&nbsp;Big Apple BBQ Block Party. It was simply amazing. Two sides of Madison Square Park were filled with people barbequing, eating barbeque, and drooling while they queued for more barbeque.After trying 3 bbq stands, I can far and away say that the the 17th Street Baby Back Ribs were the best thing I ate there. I think a whole lot of people agreed with me judging by the queue that had formed there on the second day of the event.Since Sweden isn't known for it's barbeque, I thought I'd try and see if I could do ribs anything like the crew did on that day. I'm recording the recipe and lets hope I can get to it before winter sets in.So this is what you need:Ingredients1/2 cup paprika1/4 cup kosher salt, finely ground1/4 cup sugar2 tablespoons mustard powder1/4 cup chili powder1/4 cup ground cumin2 tablespoons ground black pepper1/4 cup granulated garlic2 tablespoons cayenneCooking DirectionsMix all ingredients and store in a tightly covered container. To make it a little more hot and spicy, increase the mustard powder and black pepper to 1/2 cup each.Makes about 2 1/2 cupsIngredients1 cup ketchup (I use Hunt's)2/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar1/2 cup apple juice or cider1/4 cup apple cider vinegar1/2 cup packed brown sugar1/4 cup soy sauce or worcestershire sauce2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard3/4 teaspoon garlic powder1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper1/4 teaspoon cayenne1/3 cup bacon bits, ground in a spice grinder1/3 cup peeled and grated apple1/3 cup grated onion2 teaspoons grated green bell pepperCooking DirectionsCombine the ketchup, rice vinegar, apple juice or cider, cider vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce or worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, white pepper, cayenne, and bacon bits in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple, onion, and bell pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Stir it often. Allow to cool, then pour into sterilized glass bottles. A glass jar that used to contain mayonnaise or juice works real well. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.Makes 3 cupsVariation: to make this sauce a little hotter, add more cayenne pepper to taste, approximately another 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon. Be careful; a little cayenne goes a long way.This is how to cook them:People are mystified about how to cook ribs properly. I'm going to walk you through every step of the way as though you're using a basic charcoal grill. Obviously if you have different or more high-tech equipment, you'll need to modify these procedures. If you're setting up your backyard charcoal grill for indirect cooking, you'll want to use a disposable aluminum pan to capture the grease as the fat renders while cooking. Some people add water to this pan to add moisture to the cooking environment.Let me caution you right up front to mop the ribs with sauce no more than 10 minutes before you take them off the grill. Saucing the meat too early is a mistake many people make when smoking or grilling. Virtually all barbecue sauce contains sugar, and your meat will have a burned crust around the outside if you use sauce too soon in the process.Ribs are readily available in most grocery stores. When selecting ribs, try not to buy ones that weigh less than 2 pounds. A true baby back rib weighs about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds; they are very fragile and dry out quickly. This recipe calls for a meatier rib. A loin back rib is preferable; they're easier to cook, less fragile, and have more meat.Once you start smoking ribs, you can't leave the smoker unattended for any more than about 20 minutes. You'll need to continually check that the temperature in the grill remains between 200 and 210 degrees at all times. If it gets too hot, open the lid and allow some of the heat to escape. Coals that appear to be glowing red will cause a hot spot. Don't cook the ribs directly over the hot spot; move the ribs to a different, cooler part of the grill. If the temperature dips below 200 degrees, move the ribs to a hot spot for a while. If the temperature gets too low, add some more coals.You'll need about 4 cups of apple wood chips to be authentic; you can use hickory, pecan, sweet maple, or cherry, but the ribs won't taste as sweet. You'll also need a chimney starter or another small covered grill or bucket to keep extra hot coals.Note: this is all from Mike Mills. Ingredients4 racks of ribs (about 2 pounds each)Magic Dust (click here&nbsp;for the recipe) or your favorite dry rub4 cups apple juice in a spray bottleApple City Barbecue Sauce (click here&nbsp;for the recipe) or your favorite barbecue sauceCooking DirectionsTrim any excess fat and remove the membrane from the back of the ribs.Sprinkle the ribs liberally with magic dust, coating both sides. Put them in a shallow pan or on a cookie sheet and cover them with clear plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate them until you're ready to use them. I recommend letting them marinate for at least an hour. At the restaurant, we dust the ribs up to a day in advance.Start your fire using royal oak charcoal.Soak the apple wood chips in water for half an hour. Drain.Remove the grate and arrange the medium-hot coals in a grill or smoker. If you are using a grill, it must have a lid. Set an aluminum pan next to the coals as a drip pan. Spread out the wet wood chips on the coals. Replace the rack, close the grill, and check the temperature. It should be between 200 and 210 degrees. If the temperature is too high, open the lid to allow some heat to escape.Notice that the meat on a rack of ribs is on the top. The bottom, where you removed the membrane, is called the "bone side." Once the temperature is steady, place the ribs on the rack, bone side down. You want to cook them bone side down as much as possible. Turning them dries out the meat. If necessary, you can cut the racks of ribs in half to comfortably fit your grill.Cover and smoke the ribs for about 4-6 hours or until the ribs are done and tender. This is not an exact science; we're not baking a cake.You'll want to check the ribs every 20 minutes or so. Examine them to see if the surface of the meat looks dry or moist. Ribs "sweat" about three times during the smoking process. The pores of the meat open, and this allows moisture to escape. This is when the seasoning from the dry rub and the smoke itself are reabsorbed into the meat. When they're sweating, mop or mist them with some apple juice and sprinkle them with a little more magic dust. Opening the lid will lower the temperature; add more coals and wood chips as needed to maintain the temperature.About 10 minutes before you remove the ribs from the&nbsp;pit, mop them with the sauce. When you take them off the pit, mop again with sauce and sprinkle some more magic dust on them. Serve immediately.Serves 4, or you can cut the racks in half to serve 8.Looking forward to trying all that - unfortunately I wont have the right grill, but we'll see what we can do.

I'm recording the recipe and lets hope I can get to it before winter sets in.<br /><br />So this is what you need:<br /><br /><div class="section" id="ingredients" style="font-family: arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(226, 226, 226); color: #003366; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 15px 0px 5px; padding: 0px;">Ingredients</h4><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1/2 cup paprika</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1/4 cup kosher salt, finely ground</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1/4 cup sugar</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">2 tablespoons mustard powder</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1/4 cup chili powder</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1/4 cup ground cumin</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1/4 cup granulated garlic</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">2 tablespoons cayenne</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></li><br /><br /></div><div class="section" id="directions" style="font-family: arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(226, 226, 226); color: #003366; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 15px 0px 5px; padding: 0px;">Cooking Directions</h4><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Mix all ingredients and store in a tightly covered container.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple, onion, and bell pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Stir it often. Allow to cool, then pour into sterilized glass bottles. A glass jar that used to contain mayonnaise or juice works real well. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Makes 3 cups</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Variation: to make this sauce a little hotter, add more cayenne pepper to taste, approximately another 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon. Be careful; a little cayenne goes a long way.</div></div></div><br /><br />This is how to cook them:<br /><br /><div class="intro" style="font-family: arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">People are mystified about how to cook ribs properly. I'm going to walk you through every step of the way as though you're using a basic charcoal grill. Obviously if you have different or more high-tech equipment, you'll need to modify these procedures. If you're setting up your backyard charcoal grill for indirect cooking, you'll want to use a disposable aluminum pan to capture the grease as the fat renders while cooking. Some people add water to this pan to add moisture to the cooking environment.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Let me caution you right up front to mop the ribs with sauce no more than 10 minutes before you take them off the grill. Saucing the meat too early is a mistake many people make when smoking or grilling. Virtually all barbecue sauce contains sugar, and your meat will have a burned crust around the outside if you use sauce too soon in the process.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Ribs are readily available in most grocery stores. When selecting ribs, try not to buy ones that weigh less than 2 pounds. A true baby back rib weighs about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds; they are very fragile and dry out quickly. This recipe calls for a meatier rib. A loin back rib is preferable; they're easier to cook, less fragile, and have more meat.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Once you start smoking ribs, you can't leave the smoker unattended for any more than about 20 minutes. You'll need to continually check that the temperature in the grill remains between 200 and 210 degrees at all times. If it gets too hot, open the lid and allow some of the heat to escape. Coals that appear to be glowing red will cause a hot spot. Don't cook the ribs directly over the hot spot; move the ribs to a different, cooler part of the grill. If the temperature dips below 200 degrees, move the ribs to a hot spot for a while. If the temperature gets too low, add some more coals.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">You'll need about 4 cups of apple wood chips to be authentic; you can use hickory, pecan, sweet maple, or cherry, but the ribs won't taste as sweet. You'll also need a chimney starter or another small covered grill or bucket to keep extra hot coals.<br /><br />Note: this is all from Mike Mills. </div></div><div class="clearboth" style="clear: both; font-family: arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 1px; height: 0px; line-height: 19px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></div><div class="section" id="ingredients" style="font-family: arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(226, 226, 226); color: #003366; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 15px 0px 5px; padding: 0px;">Ingredients</h4><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">4 racks of ribs (about 2 pounds each)</li><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Magic Dust (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/recipe?id=10868429" style="color: #336699; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;" target="external">click here</a>&nbsp;for the recipe) or your favorite dry rub</li><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">4 cups apple juice in a spray bottle</li><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Apple City Barbecue Sauce (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/recipe?id=10868522" style="color: #336699; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;" target="external">click here</a>&nbsp;for the recipe) or your favorite barbecue sauce</li><br /><br /><br /><br /><li style="list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></li><br /></div><div class="section" id="directions" style="font-family: arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(226, 226, 226); color: #003366; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 15px 0px 5px; padding: 0px;">Cooking Directions</h4><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Trim any excess fat and remove the membrane from the back of the ribs.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Sprinkle the ribs liberally with magic dust, coating both sides. Put them in a shallow pan or on a cookie sheet and cover them with clear plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate them until you're ready to use them. I recommend letting them marinate for at least an hour. At the restaurant, we dust the ribs up to a day in advance.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Start your fire using royal oak charcoal.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Soak the apple wood chips in water for half an hour. Drain.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Remove the grate and arrange the medium-hot coals in a grill or smoker. If you are using a grill, it must have a lid. Set an aluminum pan next to the coals as a drip pan. Spread out the wet wood chips on the coals. Replace the rack, close the grill, and check the temperature. It should be between 200 and 210 degrees. If the temperature is too high, open the lid to allow some heat to escape.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Notice that the meat on a rack of ribs is on the top. The bottom, where you removed the membrane, is called the "bone side." Once the temperature is steady, place the ribs on the rack, bone side down. You want to cook them bone side down as much as possible. Turning them dries out the meat. If necessary, you can cut the racks of ribs in half to comfortably fit your grill.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Cover and smoke the ribs for about 4-6 hours or until the ribs are done and tender. This is not an exact science; we're not baking a cake.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">You'll want to check the ribs every 20 minutes or so. Examine them to see if the surface of the meat looks dry or moist. Ribs "sweat" about three times during the smoking process. The pores of the meat open, and this allows moisture to escape. This is when the seasoning from the dry rub and the smoke itself are reabsorbed into the meat. When they're sweating, mop or mist them with some apple juice and sprinkle them with a little more magic dust. Opening the lid will lower the temperature; add more coals and wood chips as needed to maintain the temperature.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">About 10 minutes before you remove the ribs from the&nbsp;pit, mop them with the sauce. When you take them off the pit, mop again with sauce and sprinkle some more magic dust on them. Serve immediately.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Serves 4, or you can cut the racks in half to serve 8.<br /></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;">Looking forward to trying all that - unfortunately I wont have the right grill, but we'll see what we can do.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px;"><br /></div></div>
