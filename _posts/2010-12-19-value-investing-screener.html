I needed a way to run a series of financial calculations over the entire Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).<br /><br />Conventional stock screeners allow you to order by a whole bunch of parameters, but not your own customized formulas.<br /><br />So I wrote a <a href="http://asxvaluescreener.heroku.com/">ASX value screener</a> that focuses specifically on value investing. It consists of a calculator and a screener allowing you to calculate the future intrinsic value along the likes of <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html">Warren Buffett</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham_formula">Benjamin Graham</a> and Australia's <a href="http://blog.rogermontgomery.com/">Roger Mongomerty</a>.<br /><br />I had this as an excel spreadsheet at first, but I figured if I wanted it - maybe someone else would too. So I used Ruby on Rails with the <a href="http://hobocentral.net/">hobo</a> plugin and I was up and running in a few minutes.<br /><br />I spent a few months tidying up the design and getting user feedback, I'm pretty happy with the result. There's a small amount of traffic so I'm happy to keep the site up as it's regularly being used.
