I remember Dad preparing a batch of homebrew in the evening then a lazy sunday spent bottling the 20 litres or so of beer. I have always wanted to brew over here in sweden but due to lack of linguistic knowledge, I have never found a place that I could pick up a plastic vat to ferment the beer. Until this afternoon. I went to Malm√∂ and picked up a 25L vat with all the necessary equipment on my way to band practice.<br /><br />As much fun as it was using it as a drum at practice, I brought it home tonight and using a Cooper's Pale Ale extract and a kilo of dexterous made my first brew. All ready to bottle over the weekend. I'll report back with photos and a flavour report.
