Blizzard's collectible card game [Hearthstone](https://eu.battle.net/account/download/?style=hearthstone) is an amazing example of a business model that is sustainable and appeals to players that want to spend a small amount of money - or an enormous amount without making the game 'pay to win'.

There are three ways that you can spend real money in Hearthstone, by purchasing cosmetic hero portraits, arena entries or card packs.

The cosmetic hero portraits appeal to a number of players who perhaps want to pimp their favourite class or have an affiliation with that character from Blizzard's World of Warcraft.

The arena entry is effectively a few games and a card pack so for all intensive purposes it acts as purchasing a card pack. It’s these card packs that I find so interesting.

### So how does it work?

The cards in Hearthstone are given rarities that affect how often you will find them in packs. Since you can have no more than two of the same card in a deck, having more than two of a card in your card collection serves no purpose. These surplus cards can be destroyed and a small amount of 'dust' is left, this dust can then be used to create cards that you haven't received in packs. There are also golden versions of each card that are quite rare and look quite nice, and the amount of dust on destroying a golden card is significantly higher than for a regular card.

A complete set of cards isn't necessary to enjoy the game, but a larger set of cards allows greater versatility in the type of deck that you can play and without some of the 'decent' set of cards there would be some correlation between a basic set of cards and one's winning percentage.

New players could rely on daily quests or grinding games (at a suboptimal win rate) to collect enough in game currency to purchase packs. But grinding when you are facing basic good cards that you don't have access to is an enticement to putting your hand in your pocket to grab some packs 'just to get up to speed'. But these packs only get you a small way up the card collection, but enough that you are playing an almost complete deck of your choice.

So there is a strong enticement for new players to purchase packs , but the real key to this model is the ability for committed players to spend a large amount of money to ascertain a massive collection that can play almost all heros and their deck types.

### I did the math

Using a [simple python script](https://github.com/stumacd/hearthstone-pack-opening-simulator) to simulate opening packs of cards. To get a completely functional collection of the Classic Set - 500 packs, 313 packs for GvG and 316 for TGT - so a total of 1129 packs. The cheapest that you can purchase packs is $US 0.92, making a complete functional set cost $US 1038 + the two expansions (another $US 50) making $US 1088 on average for a complete set. I 

### Tavern Brawl

There is a reasonable subset of non class specific cards and class specific cards that would allow one to construct most competitive decks. Even if this only 70% of all collectable cards there is still an awful lot of cards to collect, but Blizzard have an interest in making the most cards playable so that they will be desireable.

A new game mode was recently added to Hearthstone. A ‘Tavern Brawl’ allows one to construct custom decks in a game with non standard rules. This game space allows there to be more desireable cards on a week by week basis, encouraging the player to craft specific cards for that week and also discouraging them from dusting uncompetitive cards in the sense that they may be competitive in this alternate game mode.

### A game that costs a grand?

It would seem rediculous that anyone would play a game that costs so much, even triple A games are usually set at a $US 60 price point - but if this [survey](http://strawpoll.me/3892233/r) is anything to go by people seem quite happy to spend this much money on the game.
