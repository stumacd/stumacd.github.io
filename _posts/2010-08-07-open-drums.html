I wanted to be able to record any ideas I had for drum beats quick and easily. This was much simpler that I expeced.<br /><br />After getting <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBoQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fopendrums%2Fsource%2Fcheckout&amp;ei=zVJdTMCVGZyfOPHP5LUP&amp;usg=AFQjCNFE6rXG1vtQKBKnjJNObYrMB50dJg&amp;sig2=NYLpBHuJSFr7BqL60TGGbA">OpenDrums</a>, and installing a few graphics packages:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">$ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">$ make</span><br /><br />It works like a charm, now to change the default sounds to something a little more realistic.
