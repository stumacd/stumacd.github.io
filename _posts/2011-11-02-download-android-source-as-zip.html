Hmmm, the repo script doesn't appear to be working thanks to conflicting variables on the work set up. So to get a zip of the android source I went to&nbsp;<a href="http://rgruet.free.fr/public/">http://rgruet.free.fr/public/</a>&nbsp;and downloaded the latest.<br /><br />All the other google results were severely outdated.
