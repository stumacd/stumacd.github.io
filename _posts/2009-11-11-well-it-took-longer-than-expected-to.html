Well it took longer than expected to get the 16MHz crystals, but now that I have some and I've updated the code to communicate by packets. Testing tonight.<br /><br />I've been playing around with a few things recently. Software wise I've been honing my Java skills with a few little apps. I usually program in Eclipse but recently I've found I get a project up and running faster with <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>. I'll post them soon once they're a little prettier. The apps are:<br /><br />A basic <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143">Race for the Galaxy</a> game this interfaces with a PHP server but is incomplete as a mate implimented the game on his server.<br /><br />A Tigris and Euphrates tile counter. This can read in the game log from the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/tigris/">online implimentation </a>at BoardGameGeek and tell you what tiles are left in the game eg. the tiles left in the players hands and the bag. Useful for those precious game winning final moves.<br /><br />A program for sending data via the serial port to a 8 x 8 RGB Matrix. I saved myself the etching and purchased the semi constructed board from <a href="http://blog.spitzenpfeil.org/wordpress/">here</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">To come:</span> Organise and finish my guitar's pedalboard. I'm hoping to find an unwanted computer requisition the PSU and perform <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-an-ATX-Power-Supply-Into-a-Regular-DC-Powe/">this instuctable</a> again to get a nice smooth 12V.<br /><br />Good thing it's winter - plenty of time to do all this :)
