I thought I'd disable Unity in Compiz after a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10. Alas, it's so ingrained in the system that it totally borks the UI. To fix this I created a terminal launcher on the desktop (as Ctrl-Alt-T and Alt-F2 didn't work any more) that looked like this:<br /><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">#!/bin/sh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />gnome-terminal</div><br />Then selected the file's properties and set the execute bit to true. Then ran the file. This left me with an open terminal in which I then typed:<br /><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ccsm</div><br />This brought back unity and now the computer's back to a functional UI.<br /><br />Now all I need to do is work out how to disable that damn sidebar that gets in the way more than it help...
