Hmmm, how good are AI comps? I am letting my inner geek take over for the next few days as I put the evil stumac bot in <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/index.php">Google's AI comp.</a><br /><br />I am currently 30th (out of 415 entrants) with a few things still to do to really make my bot competitive.<br /><br />To begin with I implemented a basic strategy and that had me at 90th out of 400. When I say basic, I mean really basic (code to come after the competition).<br /><br />I then added a minimax look ahead, this currently looks ahead 9 moves, a bug was causing me to lose games.<br /><br />So now I will:<br /><ul><li>alpha beta prune my minimax.</li><li>upgrade my evaluation function.</li><li>add a 'in same area' check and revert to flooding if in separate areas.</li><li>Add a timing check (if possible) to give a good answer before timing out.</li></ul>Should be fun!<br /><br />Hopefully this should be able to get us into the top 10.
