* The Goldfinch - Donna Tartt - Great first 2/3s, great writing and a zany story.
* Night Film - Marisha Pessl - Echoes of The Magus, good read.
* Madness Rules (The Survivalist Book 4) - Arthur Bradley - Nice fun post apocolyptic read, seems a little more real than other books of this genre.
* Judgment Day (The Survivalist Book 3) - Arthur Bradley
* Anarchy Rising (The Survivalist Book 2) - Arthur Bradley
* Frontier Justice (The Survivalist Book 1) - Arthur Bradley
* Sand Omnibus - Hugh Howey - Nice chewing gum
* Looking For Alaska - John Green - Mabye I was expecting more, awkward teenage years book.
* Tollesbury Time Forever (FRUGALITY Book 1) - Stuart Ayris, Kath Middleton, Katie W.Stewart - A little off the wall but good.
* The Many Lives of Samuel Beauchamp (A Demon's Story Book 2) - Michael Siemsen - I really liked this book, but I guessed the ending a little too early.
* The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined - Steven Pinker - still haven't finished - tough going.
