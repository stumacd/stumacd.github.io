Ahhh the woes of a 64 bit machine bite again. I'm still Using Ubuntu 10.04 (I haven't seen anything worth upgrading for) so installing BankID isn't a problem as Swedbank's sucurity program has a Ubuntu distribution. But getting it to show up in Firefox is the step that they leave out of the instructions.<br /><br />The missing line is:<br /><br />$ nspluginwrapper -i /usr/local/lib/personal/libplugins.so<br /><br />ns plugin wrapper wraps your 32 bit plugin so that your 64 bit machine can use it. After restarting your browser, in your Tools -&gt; Addons -&gt; Plugins you should see a Nexus entry which is your bank ID.<br /><br />Now I don't need to switch back to windows for anything.
