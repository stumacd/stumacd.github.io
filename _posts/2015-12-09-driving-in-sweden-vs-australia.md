Despite not minding the morning commute on the train to work. I bit the bullet and put myself through the ordeal of getting a Swedish drivers' licence. Sweden allows you to drive on a foreign license for one year after you arrive - but after that you must convert your license to a Swedish one. Since I had an Australian license, this was outside the European Economic Area so I was unable to [simply convert](http://www.korkortsportalen.se/jag-har-korkort/utlandska-korkort/) it to a Swedish one. This was a little frustrating as Australians can convert their driver's' license to a British one, then switch it to a Swedish one - the critical step is living in England... this wasn't a realistic option for me. The driving theory process consisted of four components, and ended up costing around 7000 SEK.

### Right-hand rule

Apart from actually driving on the other side of the road and remembering this every time you get in the car. Sweden has a give way to the right rule that applies at intersections between 3 or 4 roads. This applies when there are no ‘priority’ roads (which are marked by a yellow diamond that you never see until you start learning to drive). This leads to smaller roads getting equal priority as a bigger ‘small’ road. This leads to very righteous driving and I have seen hatchbacks pull out in front of busses that were practically through the intersection.

### Cyclists - are everywhere.

Once in awhile you would see a cyclist on a suburban street in Melbourne or in a group on a country road. Australian drivers usually acted as if there cyclists were encroaching on their space and would often give then very little clearance.

In Sweden with cyclists everywhere and with such great bicycle paths, it is rare to get them sharing the road with you. But when they do they are often riding parallel to a well trafficed bike path. One narrow city roads they often cause bottlenecks and they tend to ignore road rules and can often make dangerous situations.

The main interaction that you have to look for is when you turn at a crossing and it is a cycling path. Simply the speed at which a cyclist can move means you are scanning such a large area looking for an often unlit bike in the winter shadows. It certainly slows me down in turning, especially a multi lane left turn.

### Blinkers

Despite the lack of light and never ending rain/snow/mush Swedes manage to resist the urge to use their indicators wherever possible. The smooth changes into your blind spot with no warning is never going to get old.

### Road toll

Despite some interesting decisions about road rules and general driving etiquette, [Sweden’s road toll is much less than Australia’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate). I find this interesting as the darkness and climate would arguably make it ‘tougher’. Perhaps Sweden’s low tolerance on driving under the influence contributes significantly to keeping the most unsafe drivers off the road.
